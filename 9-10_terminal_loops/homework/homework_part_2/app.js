interpolation ex: console.log(${varible_to_call} + " or " + other_varible);
concatenation ex: print("this is " the_varible) or my_string % (var1, var2 ,var3)

Dont Repeat yourself. keeps for cleaner code and not polluting the global scope.not sure

they are the same you can just set while loops to stop
running at a certain condition not just a number
